New

I followed the presenter's code except for these:

* You don't need to install mock anymore for Python 3
* I use LoginRequiredMixin instead login_required decorator.

Environment
------------

I used most up-to-date stable package:

* Django 2.0.6
* Python 3.6.5

A note to readers and myself:

* URLs and templates are not tested.
